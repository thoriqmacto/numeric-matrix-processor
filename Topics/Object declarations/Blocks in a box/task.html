<h2>Blocks in a box</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p><p>Let's create a simple class with a nested object. There is a box of blocks for kids. All of them are the same size but their colors can be different. We will store these objects in a class <code class="java">Block</code> with one property <code class="java">color</code> and a nested object <code class="java">BlockProperties</code> with properties <code class="java">length</code> and <code class="java">width</code>. Your task is to create this structure!</p><p>In addition, your nested object should have a <code class="java">blocksInBox()</code> function that receives the length and width (parameters order is important) of a box and returns the number of blocks this box can store.</p><p>Make the properties of a nested object mutable for the validation system! You may initialize them with any numbers, for example, 6 and 4. as in the example. Don't worry about heights, solve it like a 2D problem. Don't rotate the blocks.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Block and Box with four nested Blocks" height="150" src="https://ucarecdn.com/a8e677ed-d329-4225-9d84-55c97d43b42c/" width="164"/></p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't forget about the order of precedence! (9/4) * (14/6) = 4 but (9*14) / (6*4) = 5</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
